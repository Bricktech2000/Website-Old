The idea
--------

I first got the idea of making such a system when I was creating {this very website:: https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Website/}. I had notes everywhere for keeping track of things I needed to do on the project: on my cell phone, on my computer, inside the code itself... After a while, it gets really messy and unorganized, so I thought to myself:
	""I should totally make a program to handle it all for me!""
And so this is how {Tinker:: https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr/} got to be.


# try
How to Use it
-------------

In order to download the program, you need to install {Python 3:: https://www.python.org/downloads/} and {Git:: https://git-scm.com/downloads} on a [Windows] or [Linux] computer, and then [git clone] the following:
	[[
	https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr.git
	]]
Once you have done so, you should have the full code copied on your own machine. Then, read the {[README.md]:: https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr/} file in /Tinker/'s repository to get instructions on how to use it!


Moving Forward...
-----------------

I think this small program will help me a lot when working on larger-scale projects. I have just initialized {Tinker:: https://github.com/Bricktech2000/tkr/} on {this website:: https://github.com/Bricktech2000/Website/} to help me track everything I need to do from now on. I will use it for a little while, and probably make an update to this post to let you know if it is any good!
