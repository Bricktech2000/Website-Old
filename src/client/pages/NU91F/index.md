Why a YouTube Channel?
----------------------

I have been doing /3D designing and printing/, /programming/, /robotics/ and /electronics/ for a while now. In December of last year, I thought:
	""Why make projects when I don't even share them with the world?""
This is the moment when I decided to create my YouTube channel, {TechnoViper:: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGj6pfxZ0XYJU29XNwXPPxg/featured}.
I really wanted to start sharing everything I do with the internet, and YouTube seemed like the ideal platform to do so.

What is it All About?
---------------------

As I sait previously, I will share the projects I do on my YouTube channel. This includes...
	* RC stuff (drones, cars, boats)
	* 3D designing and printing (time lapses, tutorials)
	* Programming (/arduino/, websites, etc.)
	* Electronics (robotics, circuits, /PCBs/)
	* Anything else I feel like sharing!

Almost every post on this blog will have a corresponding video on my YouTube channel, don't forget to {check it out:: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGj6pfxZ0XYJU29XNwXPPxg/featured}!
