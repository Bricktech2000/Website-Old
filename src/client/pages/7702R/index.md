In the {previous post: ../J0EXS/}, I wrote about what is a Personnal Project in the {IB program:: https://www.ibo.org/} and showed you the parts I will use to make this drone. Don't forget to check it out!


The Parts
---------

A few days ago, I received almost all the parts necessary to build my 5-inch drone. This includes the *frame*, the *stack*, the *motors*, the *props*, and a bunch of zip ties. Of course, a few more parts need to arrive before I can start the assembly, notably the *receiver* and the *LiPo battery*. Here are a few photos of the parts I have received:

  yield include('../../body/partial/mosaic/img.html', {
    srcs: [
      path + 'IMG_20200827_182520_3.jpg',
	  path + 'IMG_20200827_184808_8.jpg',
    ]
  })

The Mockup
----------

Since I had received all of the main parts needed, I decided I would build a mockup of the drone. In order to do so, I layed them down one on top of each other to have an idea of what it would look like. I was surprised when I saw it for the first time: it was way larger than I thought it would be, measuring almost [30 cm] in length! Here are some photos of it, the last one comparing it to my {2-inch drone:: ../GLDY3/} (which you can read about {here: ../GLDY3/}!):
